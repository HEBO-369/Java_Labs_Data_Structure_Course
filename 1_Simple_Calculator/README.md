# 🧮 Simple Calculator using Java Interface

## 📌 Overview

This is a simple Java-based calculator that demonstrates the use of **interfaces** and **object-oriented principles**. The program performs basic arithmetic operations—specifically **addition** and **division**—based on user input.

The calculator reads two integers and an operator from the user, then uses an interface-based implementation to execute the appropriate operation. The division operation includes a check to prevent division by zero.

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Java `interface` declaration and implementation
- Basic arithmetic operations
- Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) structure
- Input handling using `Scanner`
- Control flow using conditional statements

---

## 🧱 Structure

- `ICalculator.java`: Defines the interface with method signatures for `add` and `div`
- `Calculator.java`: Implements the logic of addition and division
- `App.java`: Main entry point to interact with the user and perform operations

---

## ▶️ Expected Behavior

- Correctly performs `+` and `/` operations
- Handles division by zero gracefully with an error message
- Simple and clean command-line interaction
